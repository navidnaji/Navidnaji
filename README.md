#  About Me:

Hi, I'm Navid Nadji, a **cognitive neuroscience researcher** with a focus on **computational neuroscience, AI-driven brain research, and neuromarketing**. I'm pursuing a Master's in **Cognitive Neuroscience** at the University of Padova, where I use **machine learning** for experimental design and data analysis.
I have hands-on experience in **EEG, ERP, bio-signals (EDA, SCR, EMG, ECG), and eye-tracking** signals analysis.



I’m proficient in **Python, MATLAB, R, and machine learning frameworks** like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. My goal is to develop predictive models for cognitive abilities and study brain activity during complex tasks.

I'm open to collaborations in **neuroscience, neuromarketing, EEG/ERP analysis, and AI-driven research**. Let’s explore the mind’s potential together!
